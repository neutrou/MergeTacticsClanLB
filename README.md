# MergeTacticsClanLB

**MergeTacticsClanLB** is a lightweight Python project that collects and ranks members of multiple Merge Tactics clans. It fetches clan member data using the Clash Royale API and produces a leaderboard-style output based on customizable sorting logic.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
MergeTacticsClanLB/
├── fetch.py      # Fetches and stores clan members' data into members.json
├── lb.py         # Loads, sorts, and displays leaderboard from members.json

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neutrou/MergeTacticsClanLB.git
cd MergeTacticsClanLB
```

### 2. Create a `.env` File

The `.env` file is required to provide your API key and the list of clans you want to analyze.

Example:

```env
KEY=yourkey
CLANS='["clantag1", "clantag2", "clantag3", "clantag4"]'
```

> 📝 `KEY` is your API access key.  
> 📝 `CLANS` must be a valid JSON array of clan tags.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x and install required packages:
> - `requests`
> - `python-dotenv`
> - `tqdm`

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv tqdm
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Step 1: Fetch Clan Data

Run the following script to pull member data from all clans defined in `.env`. This will generate or overwrite `members.json`.

```bash
python fetch.py
```

### Step 2: View the Leaderboard

After fetching the data, you can run the leaderboard script:

```bash
python lb.py
```

This will parse the `members.json`, sort the players, and print the leaderboard to the terminal.

---

## 🛠 Customization

- Sorting logic and display format can be customized in `lb.py`.
- You can add filtering or extend the data structure saved in `fetch.py`.

---

## ❗ Notes

- Ensure your API key has access to all clans listed.
- `members.json` will be overwritten each time you run `fetch.py`.
